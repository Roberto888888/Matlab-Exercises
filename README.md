# Matlab-Exercises

Simple exam exercises from a course I took during my master programme.
Admittedly, the level of the course was pretty low, but if you're learning Matlab, take this repository as a collection of exercises to have fun with.

There are also some sparse exercises that I can't retrieve where they're from.
